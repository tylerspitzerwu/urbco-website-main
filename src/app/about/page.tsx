            URB Consulting is rooted in the University of Michigan’s Urban Technology program. 
            The founding of the club was inspired by a need for students in the Urban Tech program to gain professional experience. 
            We set out to create those opportunities ourselves by building a consulting group focused on 
            interdisciplinary projects for companies building technology spanning the physical and digital worlds.
            <br /><br />
            Now, we are proudly associated with the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, 
            the School of Information, and the College of Engineering, and we recruit members from across the 
            University&apos;s 19 colleges. Our strength is rooted in this diversity of backgrounds, with current members 
            having experience with a broad variety of roles/companies:
            <br /><br />
            • Technical Program Management at Microsoft<br />
            • Operations at GE<br />
            • Strategy at General Motors<br />
            • Real Estate Development at McDonald&apos;s<br />
            • Product at various real estate startups<br />
            • Software Engineering at CGI Consulting<br />
