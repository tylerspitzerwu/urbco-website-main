            URB Consulting is rooted in the University of Michigan&apos;s Urban Technology program.
            The founding of the club was inspired by a need for students in the Urban Tech program to gain professional experience.
            We set out to create those opportunities ourselves by building a consulting group focused on
            interdisciplinary projects for companies building technology spanning the physical and digital worlds.
            <br /><br />
            Now, we are proudly associated with the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning,
            the School of Information, and the College of Engineering, and we recruit members from across the
            University&apos;s 19 colleges. Our strength is rooted in this diversity of backgrounds, with current members
            having experience across technology, consulting, real estate, finance, startups, automotive, and more!
